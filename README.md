# XYZ Reader
- XYZ reader is feed reader app that uses Material Design Guidelines and new material design components for better UX to show very big articles at once in the app
- The app is optimized by using recycler view to load text, in this way app stays efficient in memory and shows very big articles at once. The recycler view does not load all the items at once but recycles the item holders and caches them for further use, in this way the app uses very low memory (compared to normal list view or single text view) to load three articles each being more than 1000 lines from the internet!
- XYZ is a project done under Udacity Nanodegree Projects and redesigned app from the original app given by Udacity in the Nanodegree
